# Provision Instances and depoloy the planespotter App on AWS using VMWare Cloud Assembly

- Create VPC with a public and private Subnet on a single AZ.  Deploys an Internet Gateway, with a default route on the public subnet. Deploy a NAT Gateways and default routes for it in the private subnets.

- Create and provision a front end server in the public subnet , an api server, a cache server and a mysql db server in the private subnet.

- Manually create a windows bastion host on the public subnet to connect and validate the instances on the private subnet

- Change IP addresses on the configuration file on the API  Server to point to the dbserver and cache server .

- Chnage the IP address on the ini file on the frontend server to point to the API server.


##  Create VPC

### Install the AWS CLI
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html

Login to the AWS Console and Provision a user with Programatic access 
	- Click on services and Search for IAM

	- open a terminal window and enter aws configure
	- You will be prompted for the access key , access secret and region, The access key and access secret will be found in the credentials file, Region use default region of your aws account, and output format as json

### Provision the VPC
	- clone or download the git repo 
	- Enter the following command aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name mycasoneazstack --template-body file:////<git repo>/planespotterCloud/planespotter-master/aws/vpc/SingleAZVPC.yaml
	- The VPC should be provisioned in your AWS account
	- Login to AWS . Search for CloudFormation under services and check if the stack creation is complete


### Create a Key Pair
	- Click on services and Search for EC2 and select EC2
	- On the left menu under Network and Security select KeyPairs
	- Click on KeyPairs and enter name as planeskeypair
	- A planeskeypair.pem file is generated. Store this file in a safe location do not loose this file.


###### NOTE: You can only access the compute instances in the private subnet from the public subnet

### Provision a Bastion Host
	- Click on services and Search for EC2.
	- Launch an instance, select a windows machine which is free tier eligible (Eg. Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base - ami-0410d3d3bd6d555f4)
	- Select Instance Type as t2 micro (Free tier eligible) and click on configure instances
	- Select Network as vpc -xxx | Dev
	- Select subnet as Dev Public 
	- Click on Add Storage, and Click on Tags (Key Name , Value Bastion Host)
	- Configure Security Group , create new , give the security group a name, by default RDP should be enabled
	- Click Review and launch, Select existing keypair (planeskeypair)
	- Acknowledge and launch the instance


### Delete AWS Stack

		- Terminate all instances running in the VPC
		- Search for CloudFormation under services
		- Select the Stack that was created (Eg. mycasoneazstack) 
		- Click on Actions Delete Stack

 


## VMWare Cloud Services 
	Login to your CAS Account and select VMware Cloud Assembly

### Configure Infrastructure	Configure Infrastructure
#### Cloud Account
			- Click on Infrastructure and add select Cloud Accounts under Connections
			- Click on Add Cloud Account
			- Select Amazon Webservices
			- Enter AccessKey and AccessKey (this is available in the credentials file that was downloaded while provisioning a user)
			- Click on Validate
			- Enter a Name for the account, description and tag and click on ADD

### 		Projects
			- Click on Projects under Configure
			- New Project (Eg. Planes)

### 		Cloud Zones
			- New Cloud Zone
			- Select account that was created in the previous step
			- Enter a Name (PlanesCloudZone0, Description
			- For Capabilitytags enter values Eg(planespublicsubnet, planesprivatesubnet). We will be using these tags to differentiate between the public and private subnets in our vpc. Click on create
			- For to Projects , open Panes, go to provisioning and add the PlanesCloudZone to the project and save
		
### 		Flavor Zones
			- By default there is a small , large and medium. You can add more flavor mappings , by adding a new flavor mapping and selecting your account and selecting the type of instance you require.

### 		Image Mapping
			- Add new Image mapping , enter a image name, select account , for the image enter the ami id , select the ami and save (Eg. AmazonLinuxAMI (ami-0080e4c5bc078760e), AWS Ubuntu (ami-0f9cf087c1f27d9b1))

### 		Network Profile
			- Add New Network Proifile
			- Select Account, enter name (Eg. PlanesNetworkProfile)
			- In networks select the Dev Public Subnet(AZ) and the Dev Public Subnet(AZ), these were created in your VPC when it was provisioned
			- Select the Dev Public Subnet and click on tags and enter planespublicsubnet and save
			- Select the Dev Private Subnet and click on tags and enter planesprivatesubnet and save
			NOTE: These tags are used to provision the compute intances to their respective Subnets
			- Click on create

### 	BluePrints
			- Go to blueprints and create a new blue print
			- Enter Name(Eg PlanesVPCBluePrint) and select the project as planes
			- Copy the contents of the planespotterCloud/planespotter-master/vmwarecas/blueprints/PlanesVPCBluePrint.yaml to the new blueprint
			- Go through the contents on the yaml (note the tags used for the private and public subnets)
			- Deploy the blueprint


## Verification and Configuration Changes

### 	EC2 Instances
		- Go to the EC2 dashboard . Log into AWS , serach for EC2 under services
		- You should see four new EC2 instances running in your dashboard
		- Click on the API, DB and Cache instances and make sure their subnet is the private subnet of your vpc
		- make sure that the frontend instance is on the public subnet of your vpc
		- Get private IP of all instances
		- select each instance and copy the private IP to your clipboard

### 	Connect to the instances:
### 		Windows users:
			https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html

### 		Front end Instance
			- In a terminal window navigate to the folder where the planeskeypair.pem was downloaded
			- Go to your EC2 dashboard and select the frontend instance and click on connect 
			- Follow the instructions in the popup (chmod 400 planeskeypair.pem)
			- copy the string under Example (ssh -i "planeskeypair.pem" ubuntu@<ip>)
			- Paste the string in your terminal and click on enter
			- cd /planespotterCloud/planespotter-master/frontend/app/
			- edit frontend.ini
			- Point the PLANESPOTTER_API_ENDPOINT endpoint to your API instance private ip (10.192.20.x)
			- Restart the frontend service (sudo systemctl restart frontend)

###		API Instance
			RDP into the bastion Host 
			- Go to the EC2 dashboard . Log into AWS , serach for EC2 under services
			- Select the BastionHost and copy its public IP to clip board
			- Click on Connect and follow the instructions to get password.
			- Select the planeskeypair.pem file as key file
			- Download the RDP file
			- RDP to the Bastion host using the username and password 
			- Transfer the Pem file to the bastion host
			- Follow the instructions on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html to connect to the api instance (NOTE: Connect to the API instance using the private IP 10.192.20.x)
			- use ubuntu@10.192.20.x for hostname or ip
			- On the putty terminal cd /planespotterCloud/planespotter-master/app-server/app/config/
			- edit the config.cfg file and change the DATABASE_URL ip and REDIS_HOST ip to the private ip of the DB and Cache Instace's
			- Restart the app-server service (sudo systemctl restart app-server)


## Check Planespotter Application
	- Open a Browser and enter the IPV4 public ip of the front end server on your browser.
