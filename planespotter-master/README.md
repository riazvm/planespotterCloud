Planespotter App
================
Welcome to the home of the Planespotter Cloud Native Demo App.

I developed this App to demonstrate various networking capabilities of VMware NSX in vSphere, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry environments. If you are curious to see what a VMware NSX Demo with Planespotter looks like, you can watch this Presentation at Network Field Day 17:

[![NFD17 Planespotter Demo](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/blob/master/docs/pics/NFD-Screenshot.png)](https://youtu.be/SN4eJk3C7uc "NFD17 Planespotter Demo")

Planespotter is composed of a MySQL DB that holds Aircraft registration data from the FAA. You can search through the data in the DB through an API App Server written in Python using Flask. The API App Server is also retrieving data from a Redis in memory cache that contains data from aircrafts that are currently airborne. There's a service written in Python that retrieves the Data about airborne aircrafts and pushes that data into Redis. Finally there is a Frontend written with Python Flask and using Bootstrap.

There's no specific mandatory way to deploy Planespotter. It can be deployed in various ways ranging from all in VMs, to Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, etc.

Deployment Instructions:
========================
If you are planing to deploy the application using a VM only approach, follow the [VM based deployment instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/vm_deployment/README.md).

If you want to have a deployment where everything including the MySQL DB is deployed in Kubernetes, you can follow the [full deployment in Kubernetes instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/all_k8s_deployment/README.md).

Another option is to still deploy the MySQL DB using a VM based model, but keep everything else in Kubernetes. Follow the [VM and Kubernetes Deployment instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/vm_k8s_deployment/README.md) for this.

If you want to mix VMs, Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry, follow the [VM, K8s, CF deployment instructions](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter/tree/master/docs/vm_k8s_cf_deployment/README.md).

Communication Matrix:
=====================
One of the goals of the Planespotter app is to demonstrate micro-segmentation policies in Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, vSphere with NSX, etc. Therefore the App is build with this in mind and uses quick timeouts to show the impact of firewall rule changes and includes a 'healtcheck' function that reports back communication issues between the 'microservices' of the app.

Here's the Communication Matrix of the component amongst each other and to the external world:

| Component / Source     | Component / Destination       | Dest Port | Notes                               |
