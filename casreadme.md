# What is VMWare Cloud Assembly

- VMware Cloud Assembly is used to connect public and private cloud providers to deploy machines, applications, and services that you create to those resources. You and your teams develop blueprints-as-code in an environment that supports an iterative workflow, from development to testing to production. At provisioning time, you can deploy across a range of cloud vendors. The service is a managed VMware SaaS and NaaS-based framework.

### VMware Cloud Assembly includes the following basic functions.

- Add and organize your cloud vendor resources and users. Information about deployed blueprints.

- A Marketplace provides VMware Solution Exchange blueprints and images

- Create Blueprints which is your development home. You use the canvas and the YAML editor to develop and then deploy your machines and applications.

- Deploy Blueprints to your cloud providers, get current status of your provisioned resources. Access details and history that you use to manage your deployments.

 - Add your cloud vendor accounts. 

 - Determine which regions or datastores are the cloud zones that you want your developers deploying to. 

 - Create policies that define the cloud zones. 

 - Create projects that group the developers with the cloud zones. 

#### As a blueprint developer
- You are a member of one or more projects.

- You create and deploy blueprints to the cloud zones associated with one of your projects.

- Develop blueprints for projects using the canvas. 

- Deploy your blueprints to project cloud zones based on policies and constraints.
